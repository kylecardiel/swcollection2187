My father ‘needed’ to buy us a SNES and the first game he bought with it was Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Obviously a great game. However, I was still reluctant to watch the movies. But a father knows best and he finally sat me down to watch A New Hope. The rest they say is history, as I loved all of it. Ever since that moment, ever new Star Wars movie release I’ve seen with my father on opening night (or day). Thanks to the Special Editions that means I’ve been able to see every movie in theaters at least once with him."

Having acquired things for a while, thanks to her, I‘ve got pretty decent collection. And although I know about 99% of everything I have, there are times I could use some sort of reference. There are a ton of sites that offer an archive/current database list of available collectibles. However, none of them let me keep track of which of those you own. Combined that with my career as a software engineer, it only seemed reasonable to fix my own problem and then share with other fans."

Inbetween playing with my dog Finn (my sister named) I plan to continue to add different assortment of collectibles from there."
